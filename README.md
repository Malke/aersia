Vidya Intarweb Playlist:

A project to learn web development.

Tag: 0.0.2

#Done in this version:
* Added a new font, "Titillium Web".
* Added an options menu, accessible by clicking the gear next to the Fullscreen button.
* Added a touch-style interface, automatically applied on all touchscreen devices, manually toggleable in the Options menu.
* Added some themeing support. Currently, it doesn't change the gradients on the controls bar.
* Added scrolling animation on the list when a new song is played.


#Planned for the next version:
* Increase the size of the playlist items on the touch interface
* Add some support for saving/loading/remembering themes, so if a user sets it the app will read a cookie to get their preferences, or presets.
* Re-style the Options box to use the right colors.
* Make some icons so the site will show the right graphics on the Chrome New Tab, Mozilla Recent Tabs, or Windows Metro UI panels.
* Allow switching between the different playlists.

#Planned for the future:
* Mobile support?
* Clean all the forked project cruft out
* Compile the JS
